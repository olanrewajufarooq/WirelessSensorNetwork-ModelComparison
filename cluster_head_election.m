%CLUSTER_HEAD_ELECTION Election of the Cluster Heads
%   This function gives the selection of the cluster heads in a wireless
%   sensor network (WSN) per round. 
%
%   INPUT PARAMETERS
%   SN - all sensors nodes (including routing routes)
%   p - the percentage of cluster heads desired
%   round - the round number of the simulation
%   dims - the dimensions of the WSN
%   seed - the random generation seed. Default: true. But you can pass a
%               new seed by assigning a numeric valid to the seed
%               parameter. If you don't want seeding, assign 'false'.
%
%   OUTPUT PARAMETERS
%   SN - all sensors nodes (including routing routes)
%   CL - all cluster nodes
%   CLheads - number of cluster heads elected.
